WolfGang
========

The WolfGang project goals are  multiple covering low level java tools
but also framework dedicated to components cooperation.

Contrail Network
----------------

In this approach  we call  network a  set of  connected component
which cooperate in order to solve a given problem. Such problem can be
simple one  like data  transformation, interceptors, ciphered  data or
complex service based solution.

Each component provides an upstream/downstream data management and
based  on  his  simple  design  patterns  are  provided  like: 

* initial producer,  
* terminal  consumer, 
* one  to  one  connecter, 
* multiplexer,
* demultiplexer and 
* router
