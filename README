The WolfGang project goals are  multiple covering low level java tools
but also framework dedicated to components cooperation.

<h2>Contrail Network</h2>

<p>  In this approach  we call  network a  set of  connected component
which cooperate in order to solve a given problem. Such problem can be
simple one  like data  transformation, interceptors, ciphered  data or
complex service based solution.  </p>

<p> Each component provides an upstream/downstream data management and
based  on  his  simple  design  patterns  are  provided  like  initial
producer,  terminal  consumer,  one  to  one  connecter,  multiplexer,
demultiplexer and finally router.  </p>
